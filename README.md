# CompareDLG4VtmB

This tool mainly allows you to perform a translation of the .dlg and .lip files of the game Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines. It also allows you to re-encode the .lips and prepare the necessary .mp3/.wav/.vcd files in case you need to generate new genre-based lines.

This tool has been prepared to update also an existing translation and apply the old lines to the new version. However, a manual check is needed to verify that the lines are correct (that the context of the lines remains the same). The possibility to use an external translator such as DEEPL has also been added.

This is the main window of VtMBTranslator:
